# Nature of Code

This is an in-progress implementation of the projects in the book _The Nature of Code_ by Daniel Schiffman, 2024.

As I have a dislike for JavaScript, I have decided to attempt to code the convenience of the Processing library calls
into pure Kotlin, using functional programming where it makes sense to do so.

This code will be in a state of flux and active development for some time.
